## How It Works

### Dashboard page

- The initial app screen should be a dashboard, to display important information for the last 7, 30, or 90 days:
- A list of guests checking in and out on the current day. Users should be able to perform these tasks from here
- Statistics on recent bookings, sales, check ins, and occupancy rate
- A chart showing all daily hotel sales, showing both “total” sales and “extras” sales (only breakfast at the moment)
- A chart showing statistics on stay durations, as this is an important metric for the hotel

### Bookings

- App needs a table view with all bookings, showing arrival and departure dates, status, and paid amount, as well as cabin and guest data
- The booking status can be “unconfirmed” (booked but not yet checked in), “checked in”, or “checked out”. The table should be filterable 
by this important status
- Other booking data includes: number of guests, number of nights, guest observations, whether they booked breakfast, breakfast price

### Cabins
- App needs a table view with all cabins, showing the cabin photo, name, capacity, price, and current discount
- Users should be able to update or delete a cabin, and to create new cabins (including uploading a photo)

### Users

- Users who have registered on the system are allowed to create new user accounts

### Settings

- Users should be able to define a few application-wide settings: breakfast price, min and max nights/booking, max guests/booking

### Theming
- The app should include the option to switch between dark and light mode
